<h2>Mapping water level and water quality</h2>
<img src="project.jpg" alt="pro img">
<p>Water is at the core of sustainable development and is critical for socio-economic
development, healthy ecosystems and for human survival itself. Water is finite and
irreplaceable resource that is fundamental to human being. It is only renewable if well
managed .In our point of view CEG campus being a wide and eco-friendly campus has been
identified with a whopping sum of bore wells and open wells all within it. But still the water
resources within the CEG campus are known to be low yielding at adverse times. In addition
to this the water quality of the various water resources remains a question to be answered
.Several parameters were discussed to get the best possible results and a set of observation
wells were classified based on these parameters. Based on the observations made at the
indicated locations, we have developed an estimation of the water levels and water quality for
the entire CEG campus. This estimation can be approximated to the total water consumption
in CEG campus per day .Knowing the yield of different water resources within the campus
and the consumption of these resources, the additional amount of water required to meet the
demands of the campus can be assessed .In addition to this the water quality was analyzed
and constructive suggestions have been provided..This in fact would give a clear picture of
the availability and sustainability of water resources in CEG campus. The objectives,
methodology and the outcomes of the study have been discussed briefly in the forthcoming</p><br><hr>
<h2>Electric Motor drive for bicycle with battery</h2>
<img src="project1.jpg" alt="pro1 img">
<p>Electric Bicycles have been gaining attention as an efficient
and clean means of transportation. Our report focuses on the design
and implementation of a hybrid powered electric bicycle employing a
dc-dc power converter. Two DC sources are used: battery and super
capacitor. The super capacitor is connected in parallel to the battery
and a dc-dc converter is designed in closed loop which arbitrates
power between the battery and super capacitor. The purpose of
employing super capacitor is to drive the vehicle during the peak
power required by the load. The main components of the proposed
electric bicycle are: battery, super capacitors, dc-dc converter,
controller and BLDC motor. These components are modeled in
MATLAB. Three topologies of dc-dc converter are investigated for the
electric bicycle and they are compared in terms of ripple at the input
and the output and from the results it is found that the modified
boost converter results in reduced ripple. The lead acid battery and
super capacitor are modeled in SIMULINK to obtain the voltage and
current waveform. A prototype of the proposed dc-dc converter is
built alongwith controller and it is tested.</p><br><hr>
<h2>Wireless Intercom</h2>
<img src="project2.jpg" alt="pro3 img">
<p>The Raspberry Pi is a low cost, credit-card sized computer that plugs into a computer
monitor or TV, and uses a standard keyboard and mouse. It is a capable little device
that enables people of all ages to explore computing, and to learn how to program in
languages like Scratch and Python. It’s capable of doing everything you’d expect a
desktop computer to do, from browsing the internet and playing high-definition
video, to making spreadsheets, word-processing, and playing games.
The Raspberry Pi has the ability to interact with the outside world, and has been used
in a wide array of digital maker projects, from music machines and parent detectors
to weather stations and tweeting birdhouses with infra-red cameras. We want to see
the Raspberry Pi being used by kids all over the world to learn to program and
understand how computers work.
Here in this project we have used a Raspberry Pi 3 Model B as shown below.
A Mumble server (called Murmur) has a root channel and a hierarchical tree of
channels beneath it. Users can temporarily connect channels to create larger virtual
channels. This is useful during larger events where a small group of users may be
chatting in a channel, but are linked to a common channel with other users to hear
announcements. It also matches team-based first-person shooter (FPS) games. Each
channel has an associated set of groups and access control lists which control user
permissions. The system supports many usage scenarios, at the cost of added
configuration complexity.</p><br><hr>
<h2>Query Optimization in Big data using Hadoop, HIVE and NEO4J</h2>
<img src="project3.jpg" alt="pro3 img">
<p>To store, retrieve and analyze Big data in an efficient way using both relational as well
as graph database. The Hadoop architecture encompassing Hive, HDFS and
Mapreduce is chosen as the relational database while Neo4J is taken as the graph
database.</p><br>
<p>The data to be queried has to be loaded into the hdfs storage space provided by
Hadoop. The database schema has to be created and the data should be loaded into the
database used by Hive which provides the interface for the SQL like syntax. The
queries have to be executed and the execution times are noted down. The optimization
techniques like indexing, hashing, bucketing and partitioning have to be applied and
the performance gains are noted. Also the graph database implementation in Neo4j
with data ingestion into it and the cypher queries have to be executed.</p><br><hr>
